> **Author: Team 2**
> Ashba Adil, Soohyun Kim, Janice Mak, Sharon Wu

## Introduction

Our team's primary objective is **to develop Machine Learning models that identify and flag insincere questions** in Quora.  

We will be using classification and neural network based models to help Quora uphold their policy of "Be Nice, Be Respectful" and continue to be a place for the world to share knowledge.  

To gain a better understanding of our project, please refer to the following documentation and presentation slides below:
